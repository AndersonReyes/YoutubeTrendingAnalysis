# Youtube trending videos analysis

In this project I try to perform an analysis on the kaggle youtube trending dataset. The analysis and modelling was performed on the US videos data but used the other countries to evaluate the model. After the analysis I used a one class svm with a radial basis function for the data. The dataset gets updated daily with the current trending videos but I used the data from november 17 to dec 14. So there were huge assumptions in the modellin part.
