Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press."

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

It was inspired by a painting called ‘The Dance Of Life’ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It’s an illustration of three women—one in white, one in red and one in black—and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it. Since ‘When I Was Young’ is all about nostalgia and reflecting on life—especially the past, but also the now and the future—it just seemed like the perfect time to do it.”  - MØ\n \nWhen I Was Young EP Out Now:\nRetail: http://smarturl.it/WIWYRet\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WIWYIT\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WIWYAM\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WIWYSP\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/WIWYGP\n \nWhen I Was Young (Lyric Video): http://smarturl.it/WIWYYT\n \nRoots (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RootsYT\nTurn My Heart to Stone (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/TMHTSYT\nLinking With You (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/LWYYT\nBb (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/BbYTB\nRun Away (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RAYT\n \nMØ on Tour with Cashmere Cat: http://smarturl.it/MeowTour\n\nFollow MØ: \nWebsite - http://momomoyouth.com\nFacebook - http://smarturl.it/MOfacebook\nInstagram - http://smarturl.it/MOinstagram\nTwitter - http://smarturl.it/MOtwitter\nMailer - http://smarturl.it/MOmail\n \nWhen I Was Young Lyrics:\n \nWhen the sky was gold\nand I needed no protection\nas the wind would blow\na 1000 miles in no direction\nman it was a beautiful sight\ndays were soaked in sunlight\njust so long ago\nbut lately I like to imagine\n\nWhen I was young\nwhatever happened it would do me no wrong\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\nwhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on\nwe were so high\nlet the freeway take us into the night\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\nWhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nwhen I was young\n\nNow the sky is grey\nbut honestly it doesn't hurt me\nI learned to find my way\non the path of no returning\nEverything I've left behind\nI'm reminded every time I meet ur eyes\nwe were so bold and brave\nbaby can you imagine\n\nWhen I was young\nwhatever happened it could do me no wrong\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\nwhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on\nwe were so high\nlet the freeway take us into the night\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\nWhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nWhen I was young\n\nWhen I was young\nwe would play with fire\nWhen I was young\nand we would fuck the price\nwhen I was young\nIt was do or die I would give my life just to feel like\nWhen I was young\n \nAnd the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nWhen I was young\n \nMusic video by MØ performing When I Was Young (C) 2017 Sony Music Recordings, Inc."

So sorry! I️t will be back up and running soon! \n\nAs some of you may know, I lost my dad to kidney cancer almost 5 years ago. It has been a traumatic and grief filled world for me for so many reasons. Simply put, he was my dad. He was the main man in my life for almost all of my life and really ruled at it. I miss him every single day. More recently, really since Sonny was born, I find myself missing him more and more. It’s unfortunate how such amazing times in ones life, like getting married or having a baby, can be colored with such darkness. Again, I hate to be a total downer, but this is the reality of so many of our lives. This doesn’t mean we love our husbands or our babies or even our whole lives any less, it’s just that it’s difficult to fully feel pure happiness at these momentous occasions. Sometimes I’m ridden with the simple thought of how much better life would be with my dad and that just makes me so sad. Once I  get to that dark place though, my mind has the ability to take a turn and see not only how lucky I am for what I have, but how lucky I was to have a parent that taught me how to be a good parent in return. In this Chapter of I Love My Baby, But I Miss My Dad, we cover missing my dad, honoring my dad and passing on the lessons he taught me so his legacy lives on and on and on. He deserves that. I’d love to know how any of you out there who have lost parents have taught your children about them and kept the spirit of them alive. Comment below. Love you all.\n\nMusic Used: \nAvocado Street\nGymnopedie No1\nReflection Pool\nLife in Romance\nSimple Story"

Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\n\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath. I was questioning my own sanity for just a second but then remembered I am committed to getting the shot no matter what so I charged on about a 1/4 mile into Lake Geneva with my Canon 5D Mark II with 1080p HD video built in. It turned out that a monopod and my 24-105 lens was the perfect combination for the video project.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nMusic by Secrets in Stereo.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press."

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

It was inspired by a painting called ‘The Dance Of Life’ by one of my favorite artists, Edvard Munch. It’s an illustration of three women—one in white, one in red and one in black—and tells a story about three stages of human life: youth, maturity, and old age. I was always drawn to this image as a kid due to its simple symbolism and emotion and have been dying to do a video that could reflect on it. Since ‘When I Was Young’ is all about nostalgia and reflecting on life—especially the past, but also the now and the future—it just seemed like the perfect time to do it.”  - MØ\n \nWhen I Was Young EP Out Now:\nRetail: http://smarturl.it/WIWYRet\niTunes: http://smarturl.it/WIWYIT\nApple Music: http://smarturl.it/WIWYAM\nSpotify: http://smarturl.it/WIWYSP\nGoogle Play: http://smarturl.it/WIWYGP\n \nWhen I Was Young (Lyric Video): http://smarturl.it/WIWYYT\n \nRoots (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RootsYT\nTurn My Heart to Stone (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/TMHTSYT\nLinking With You (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/LWYYT\nBb (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/BbYTB\nRun Away (Official Audio): http://smarturl.it/RAYT\n \nMØ on Tour with Cashmere Cat: http://smarturl.it/MeowTour\n\nFollow MØ: \nWebsite - http://momomoyouth.com\nFacebook - http://smarturl.it/MOfacebook\nInstagram - http://smarturl.it/MOinstagram\nTwitter - http://smarturl.it/MOtwitter\nMailer - http://smarturl.it/MOmail\n \nWhen I Was Young Lyrics:\n \nWhen the sky was gold\nand I needed no protection\nas the wind would blow\na 1000 miles in no direction\nman it was a beautiful sight\ndays were soaked in sunlight\njust so long ago\nbut lately I like to imagine\n\nWhen I was young\nwhatever happened it would do me no wrong\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\nwhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on\nwe were so high\nlet the freeway take us into the night\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\nWhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nwhen I was young\n\nNow the sky is grey\nbut honestly it doesn't hurt me\nI learned to find my way\non the path of no returning\nEverything I've left behind\nI'm reminded every time I meet ur eyes\nwe were so bold and brave\nbaby can you imagine\n\nWhen I was young\nwhatever happened it could do me no wrong\nas long as I could sing my favorite song\nwhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on\nwe were so high\nlet the freeway take us into the night\nand in the dark you sang my favorite song\nWhen I was young, oh\nand the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nWhen I was young\n\nWhen I was young\nwe would play with fire\nWhen I was young\nand we would fuck the price\nwhen I was young\nIt was do or die I would give my life just to feel like\nWhen I was young\n \nAnd the holidays went on and on and on and on and on\nWhen I was young\n \nMusic video by MØ performing When I Was Young (C) 2017 Sony Music Recordings, Inc."

But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\n\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the “conduct described” in the allegations” should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.” She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside “if the allegations are true.”\nConway went on to state that the president isn’t overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\n“I will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,” Conway said. “So he made a statement, he’s sticking by that statement.”\nShe continued, “He’s not being briefed on this bit by bit. He’s very focused on trade agreements. He’s very focused on global cooperation on a ........”\nRaddatz pressed Conway if she questioned the veracity of the accusations, leading Conway to state that she can only go off of what she reads but that she doesn’t know the accusers or Roy Moore. At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn’t always be prosecuting people through the press."

As you see, Face ID has been enabled.\n\nBecause no one stands in front of it, the iPhone asks me to enter the passcode to access it.\n\nNow, I will try unlocking this iPhone with a specially crafted mask. \n\nWoa, as you see, I have successfully unlocked the iPhone X with the mask.\n\nThis iPhone is mine, clearly I can easily unlock it with my face.\n\nIn conclusion, Face ID on this iPhone X is not as secure as Apple has announced. \n\nThank you !\n____________________________________\n\nWebsite Bkav: http://bkav.com\nFacebook Bkav: https://www.facebook.com/BkavCorp"

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there’s nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I’ve been excited for the movie but don’t know how to take the limited reactions I’ve been seeing. Help.\n\nPATREON Supporter Jason Kaiser - You mentioned that Disney was in talks to buy Fox in order to compete with Netflix. If that’s the case, why doesn’t Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show. Now that the first reactions by movie critics have come out for The Justice League, do you still believe that it will become the #1 comic book movie of 2017 and join the Billion Dollar Club?"

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."

I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her.

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in.

Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?"

Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150"

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?"

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150"

Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of “normal” life. It’s a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack’s emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again—which is easier said than done, even when they’re all Incredible.\n \nDirected by Brad Bird (“Iron Giant,” “The Incredibles”) and produced by John Walker (“The Incredibles”) and Nicole Grindle (“Sanjay’s Super Team” short, “Toy Story 3” associate producer), “Incredibles 2” busts into theaters on June 15, 2018."

They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insist….\nThis is not a military takeover of government. \n\nOnce praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabwe’s new constitution with the support of the people. \n\nBut soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator.\n\nHe secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of  state-sponsored torture and killings.\n\nAnd even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, there’s evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. \n\nNow that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever.\n\nAnd it’s caused a split in Mugabe’s own party, the ZANU-PF.\nOn one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabe’s sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabwe’s independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.   \n\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her.

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

Is it because they have a deadline to keep? Or they ran out of budget? Or simply they haven't noticed it? If people like you and I can see that its poor CGI work, how come the experts in studios are comfortable in releasing the films with it?\n\nPATREON Supporter Anurag P - Big fan since the AMC days. I don't know if you have seen the most recent trailer of the new Brie Larson movie Basmati Blues, but the trailer as a whole really gave off the impression of another white person trying to come to India to save it while playing on common Indian stereotypes. As an Indian myself it is increasingly frustrating seeming so many Indian actors being typecast or Indian culture being used in such fashion.\n\nAlejandro Alonzo - Hey John!  It has been the case that a lot of Marvel movies have bad villains, but great heroe development. Critics usually like those movies enough to give them a fresh review on RT. We've been hearing similar comments about JL, if it turns out this movie gets a rotten. Is there a case to be made that there is a negative bias around WB, or a positive one around Marvel?\n\nPATREON Supporter Alan Dale - Hi John,  when you talk about all time highest box office grossing movies why isn't adjusted for inflation taken into account? Surely the box office is based on the number of actual tickets sold per film? Im sure the all time top 10 list of films would look very different. Can you please explain this as it’s always puzzled me. Thanks and keep up the great work.\n\nFrancisca Ramirez - Ben being done as Batman seems like a foregone conclusion at this point. Is Matt Reeves is still working on a stand alone Batman film or would that be cancelled if Affleck walks?"

Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Returning in a more boyish style, Samuel released the title track ‘Candy’ with the new jack swing-based arrangement of the 1990s. Particularly, a special artist, producer D.O, participated in ‘Talkbox’ of the title track ‘Candy’. The second collaboration between Brave Brother and D.O is raising expectations. \n\n#1theK#원더케이#Newrelease#Samuel#사무엘#캔디#Candy\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc\n\n[ 사무엘 ]\n\n‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 의 데뷔앨범 [SIXTEEN]에서 소년다운 모습을 보여준 ‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 이 3개월 만에 정규 1집 [EYE CANDY]으로 돌아왔다.\n더욱더 소년다운 느낌으로 돌아온 ‘사무엘’의 타이틀곡 '캔디'는 1990년대를 풍미한 뉴잭스윙 장르 기반의 편곡이 인상적인 곡이다. 특히 이번 타이틀곡 ‘캔디’에는 특별한 아티스트가 참여하였는데 바로 프로듀서 '이현도(D.O)'의 ‘Talkbox’ 참여가 눈길을 이끈다. ‘용감한 형제’ 와 ‘이현도(D.O)’의 또 한 번의 호흡이 기대를 모은다."

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150"

They patrolled the streets, blocked access to government buildings, and took over the state television station to insist….\nThis is not a military takeover of government. \n\nOnce praised as a war hero, Robert Mugabe helped Zimbabwe win independence from Great Britain in 1980. He became president under Zimbabwe’s new constitution with the support of the people. \n\nBut soon, he digressed into a repressive dictator.\n\nHe secured his power through aggression and threats, there have been reports of  state-sponsored torture and killings.\n\nAnd even though Zimbabwe is technically a democracy, there’s evidence Mugabe rigged elections in his favor. \n\nNow that Mugabe is 93 years old, and reportedly in poor health, the fight for political influence is more important than ever.\n\nAnd it’s caused a split in Mugabe’s own party, the ZANU-PF.\nOn one side we have the old guard lead by Mugabe’s sacked vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa. Like Mugabe, he fought for Zimbabwe’s independence and has a checkered past that includes human rights abuses against political opponents and ethnic minorities.   \n\n\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing.

Be prepared for that\nAdd two eggs\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \nReduce it to 350. \nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call.

There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Returning in a more boyish style, Samuel released the title track ‘Candy’ with the new jack swing-based arrangement of the 1990s. Particularly, a special artist, producer D.O, participated in ‘Talkbox’ of the title track ‘Candy’. The second collaboration between Brave Brother and D.O is raising expectations. \n\n#1theK#원더케이#Newrelease#Samuel#사무엘#캔디#Candy\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc\n\n[ 사무엘 ]\n\n‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 의 데뷔앨범 [SIXTEEN]에서 소년다운 모습을 보여준 ‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 이 3개월 만에 정규 1집 [EYE CANDY]으로 돌아왔다.\n더욱더 소년다운 느낌으로 돌아온 ‘사무엘’의 타이틀곡 '캔디'는 1990년대를 풍미한 뉴잭스윙 장르 기반의 편곡이 인상적인 곡이다. 특히 이번 타이틀곡 ‘캔디’에는 특별한 아티스트가 참여하였는데 바로 프로듀서 '이현도(D.O)'의 ‘Talkbox’ 참여가 눈길을 이끈다. ‘용감한 형제’ 와 ‘이현도(D.O)’의 또 한 번의 호흡이 기대를 모은다."

Four years after the surprise reveal and my hugely viral video, we're back for the presentation of the revised Devel Sixteen with a 12.3l V16 and quad turbochargers that is potentially capable of 5,000 horsepower... Just to double check you read that right, not 500, literally 5,000 with three zeros!\n\nTaking the philosophy of drag racer, the car has a hugely long wheelbase and comes with three various states of engine configuration; a 2,000hp V8 setup, a 3,000hp V8 racing level and then the full-hog 5,000hp quad turbo V16 if you want to go completely bonkers. With the presentation also featuring the original prototype, it was fun to be reunited but move focus to the latest version of a potential production concept. Equally on the stand we find the Devel 60; a 6-wheeler portal axle equipped monster of an off-roader. In this case powered by a 6.7l turbo diesel V8 with 720hp and over 1,000nm.\n\nEnzo Ferrari once said If you can dream, you can do it and the team behind Devel Sixteen aren't holding back in their quest to create the dream hypercar.\n\nThanks for watching, Tim\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT\nWebsite: http://www.shmee150.com\nFacebook: http://www.fb.com/shmee150\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150"

Using gripping rotoscoping techniques the latest film sees Red Bull’s young gun demonstrate unique tricks including world-firsts in freestyle mountain biking: Bum Slide, 270 Rim Bonk, Hitching Post Flip to Feet, Decade Tsunami, Superman Backflip to tuc no-hander.\n\nWithin the film, an advanced editing technique ‘rotoscoping’ was used by Cut Media to enable the audience to see what's going through Matt’s head as he prepared for seemingly impossible tricks.

But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

1455,ZvdTNDMru78,Tuesday,I Tried The Tom Brady Diet And Nutrition Plan,Business Insider,News & Politics,Overnight(12a-5a),"Business Insider|""Tom Brady""|""Football""|""Sports""|""Athlete""|""Diet""|""Health""|""Nutrition""|""Fitness""|""TB12""|""Food""|""Workout""",16456,299,44,40,"I tried the intense diet and fitness regimens that 40-year-old NFL quarterback Tom Brady touts in his new book The TB 12 Method. Along with a diet that's heavy on vegetables and lean protein, Brady stays away from alcohol, caffeine, dairy, and sugar. \n\nThis is what it was like to eat and train like Tom Brady for a week, including a taste test of the avocado ice cream Brady is known to enjoy. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nI just tried the Tom Brady diet for a week. So, Tom Brady's got this new book called The TB12 Method. In the book, he outlines in detail the fitness regimens he undertakes and diet as well. Tom Brady's nutrition plan definitely made me tweak my already-okay diet. \n\nIn terms of the food that I ate during the week, you're staying away from sugars and dairies and refined carbohydrates, etc. It's a lot of vegetables, lean white meats. We had ground turkey burgers over lots of greens, peppers, and carrots. We also had a grilled chicken breast, some Brussels sprouts, and then quinoa. Then during the day, I would eat an apple. I would eat almonds.\n\nTom Brady is all about the hydration and constantly drinking water. It's recommended that you take your total body weight, cut that in half, and then drink the corresponding amount of ounces of water that's half your body weight. Every day I would drink approximately 90 ounces of water. Three big Poland Spring bottles of water.\n\nIn terms of caffeine, I usually drink like four cups of coffee a day on average, which is a lot. It's too much. Tom Brady — he does not drink caffeine, but he recommended a maximum amount of 200 milligrams of caffeine a day,  and that equals two cups of coffee.\n\nIn terms of alcohol, Tom Brady, in the book, says that he does occasionally have a cocktail, but he says that, if you're going to drink alcohol, you need to match the ounce-amount of alcohol that you drink with water. So if you have a 12-ounce beer, you need to drink a 12-ounce glass of water.\n\nOne of the dishes that I tried was the avocado ice cream, which Tom Brady's been famous for making before. I wasn't a fan of the avocado ice cream. Sorry, Tom.\n\nOverall, the Tom Brady TB12 experience was a big improvement over my regular routine. I love always focusing on eating healthy and avoiding unhealthy, rich, sugary foods. I think this is definitely a positive tweak for me. I feel like it's already had a positive impact on me. \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \n\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \n\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \n\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\n\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company."

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing. I just don't think it's right.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

When my wife and I received our iPhone X, we had no such intention. However, things changed right after we were done setting up our new iPhones on November 3rd. We were sitting down in our bedroom and were just done setting up the Face IDs, our 10-year-old son walked in anxious to get his hands on the new iPhone X. Right away my wife declared that he was not going to access her phone. Acting exactly as a kid would do when asked to not do something, he picked up her phone and with just a glance got right in. You can get more details of the whole event and further testing that we did from Andy Greenberg’s article on WIRED: https://www.wired.com/story/10-year-old-face-id-unlocks-mothers-iphone-x/\n\nI have also written about it on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-10-year-old-son-can-unlock-wifes-iphone-x-using-face-malik/"

Henson To Star\n\n-Mail Bag\n\n-Live Twitter Questions\n\nThanks to a report from The Playlist, it looks as though Rotten Tomatoes won’t be unveiling their score for Justice League until Thursday at 12:01am ET—nearly a full day after reviews go online. The reason actually comes as part of a promotion for a new See It/Skip It show on Facebook, in which Rotten Tomatoes will officially unveil the score for new releases.  Though many have taken online to say there’s a massive conspiracy afoot with WB trying to delay the score until the movie drops for Thursday night showings, it’s likely this is simply a promotion for the Rotten Tomatoes original series.\n\nIn a new report from Variety, three studios have emerged as the front-runners to distribute Quentin Tarantino’s next movie. The top three include Warner Bros., Sony and Paramount, with Warners actually transforming their lot to match the time period, using The Warner Bros. logo from 1969 as the marquee outside the studio. Sony also reportedly created a big pitch focused on marketing and domestic. As previously reported, Tarantino is eying Margot Robbie for the role of Sharon Tate, and is said to have also written roles for Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and now Tom Cruise.\n\nBUY OR SELL\n\nIn a report from the Wall Street Journal, Illumination Entertainment is nearing an agreement with Nintendo to make an animated Super Mario Bros. movie based on the iconic video game. Illumination is owned by Chris Meledandri and Universal Studios, and has produced the Despicable Me and Secret Life of Pets franchises. Illumination’s Mac Guff studio in Paris is currently in the early stages of development, with a release date yet to be determined. \n\nIn a recent appearance on CBS Sunday Morning, original Halloween creator John Carpenter revealed that Blumhouse’s new Halloween movie would ignore all the sequels, but declined to reveal much else. We now have a bit more clarity courtesy of co-writer Danny McBride. In an interview with Yahoo, McBride definitively revealed the time frame we’ll see in the upcoming horror redo.\n\nDeadline reports that Paramount Players has signed Empire‘s Taraji P. Henson to star in What Men Want, a comedy remake inspired by the 2000 Nancy Meyers hit romantic comedy What Women Want. The new version follows a female sports agent who has been constantly boxed out by her male colleagues. When she gains the power to hear men’s thoughts, she is able to take advantage of the gift and races to sign the NBA’s next superstar. \n\nMAIL BAG\n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Ashley: https://twitter.com/AshleyMova\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO"

Returning in a more boyish style, Samuel released the title track ‘Candy’ with the new jack swing-based arrangement of the 1990s. Particularly, a special artist, producer D.O, participated in ‘Talkbox’ of the title track ‘Candy’. The second collaboration between Brave Brother and D.O is raising expectations. \n\n#1theK#원더케이#Newrelease#Samuel#사무엘#캔디#Candy\n\n▶1theK FB  : http://www.facebook.com/1theK\n▶1theK TW : https://twitter.com/1theK\n▶1theK Kakao : https://goo.gl/otRpZc\n\n[ 사무엘 ]\n\n‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 의 데뷔앨범 [SIXTEEN]에서 소년다운 모습을 보여준 ‘사무엘(Samuel)’ 이 3개월 만에 정규 1집 [EYE CANDY]으로 돌아왔다.\n더욱더 소년다운 느낌으로 돌아온 ‘사무엘’의 타이틀곡 '캔디'는 1990년대를 풍미한 뉴잭스윙 장르 기반의 편곡이 인상적인 곡이다. 특히 이번 타이틀곡 ‘캔디’에는 특별한 아티스트가 참여하였는데 바로 프로듀서 '이현도(D.O)'의 ‘Talkbox’ 참여가 눈길을 이끈다. ‘용감한 형제’ 와 ‘이현도(D.O)’의 또 한 번의 호흡이 기대를 모은다."

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service. It has a lot of truckers worried. \n\nRead Karen Levy's work here: \nhttps://goo.gl/XHYuvv \nhttps://goo.gl/BVJWmY\n\nRead the FMCSA's report on ELD safety:\nhttps://goo.gl/ydYx1R\n\nRead the NAS report on driving fatigue:\nhttps://goo.gl/VJVZMa\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

The allegations include incidents with women under the age of 16 when he was in his 30s.\n\nMoore has vehemently denied the allegations. But he has done little over the past few weeks to clear up what has emerged as a pattern from the women.\n\nAnd by the way, he totally denies it, Trump said. The president also said the recent spike in women coming forward to share their stories of being sexually harassed or assaulted by powerful men is a good thing for US society.\n\nTrump, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct from more than a dozen women during last year's presidential campaign — claims he said were all lies — had not previously addressed the Moore allegations. But amid his trip to Asia, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump believed if the allegations are true, Moore will do the right thing and step aside.\n\nTrump's comments come a day after White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox & Friends that Democratic nominee Doug Jones, the candidate running against Moore in Alabama, will be a vote against tax cuts and is weak on crime. Though she didn't explicitly tell viewers to vote for Moore, she said, I'm telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Tuesday that Conway spoke with Trump about the Alabama Senate race prior to appearing on the Fox News morning show.\n\nIn a Tuesday press conference, Dean Young, a strategist for Moore's campaign, said Conway's comments amounted to an endorsement of their candidate from the White House.\n\nIvanka Trump, the president's daughter and an assistant to him in the White House, told The Associated Press that there is a special place in hell for people who prey on children.\n\nI've yet to see a valid explanation and I have no reason to doubt the victims' accounts, she said.\n\nMoore has been disavowed by most of the Republican elected officials in Washington, DC. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee had already withdrawn their support for his candidacy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019.

Eve reacts, saying, I worked with Nicki, I got to know her on 'Barbershop,' she's an amazing rapper, and as a lyricist I respect her, but as a woman, from my point of view, I would not be able to do that. I think in this climate, it's not good. I think every artist has a right to express themselves however they want to express themselves and I respect that as well. For me, as I started coming up in the business, I started realizing that young girls were looking up to me and younger people were looking up to me, and that, not that you want to be a role model, but it becomes what you become, it is what you are. She continues, As I've gotten older...I'd just rather be a voice that's uplifting...I can be a voice for those girls that might not have a voice, in a different way without showing myself off...For the Nicki fans, I love her, respect her. Go women in hip hop. It's not my thing. I just don't think it's right.\n\nSubscribe To The Talk Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/10hBiIw\nWatch Full Episodes of The Talk HERE: http://bit.ly/Wz3H0U\nFollow “The Talk” on Twitter HERE: http://bit.ly/1OLLdk1\nLike The Talk on Facebook HERE: http://on.fb.me/12v9WlC\nFollow “The Talk” on Instagram HERE: http://bit.ly/1hggnWc\nFollow The Talk on Google+ HERE: http://bit.ly/1SOobzn\n\nGet the CBS app for iPhone & iPad!

Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow."

Watch the new trailer for #12StrongMovie.\n—\nChris Hemsworth and Oscar nominee, Michael Shannon, star in 12 STRONG, a powerful new war drama from Alcon Entertainment, Black Label Media and Jerry Bruckheimer Films. \n\nSet in the harrowing days following 9/11, a U.S. Special Forces team, led by their new Captain, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), is chosen to be the first U.S. troops sent into Afghanistan for an extremely dangerous mission. There, in the rugged mountains, they must convince Northern Alliance General Dostum (Navid Negahban) to join forces with them to fight their common adversary: the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies. In addition to overcoming mutual distrust and a vast cultural divide, the Americans—accustomed to state-of-the-art warfare—must adopt the rudimentary tactics of the Afghani horse soldiers. But despite their uneasy bond, the new allies face overwhelming odds: outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy that does not take prisoners.\n\nDirected by Nicolai Fuglsig and based on the acclaimed “Horse Soldiers” book by best-selling author Doug Stanton, 12 STRONG also stars Michael Peña, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stowell, Ben O’Toole, Austin Hebert, Kenneth Miller, Kenny Sheard, Jack Kesy, Laith Nakli, Fahim Fazli, Yousuf Azami, Said Taghmaoui, Elsa Pataky, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.\n—\nFollow #12StrongMovie on social media:\nhttp://12strongmovie.com \nhttp://facebook.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://twitter.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://instagram.com/12StrongMovie"

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about.

A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off.

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://simonscat.theofficialwebshop.com/"

Watch the new trailer for #12StrongMovie.\n—\nChris Hemsworth and Oscar nominee, Michael Shannon, star in 12 STRONG, a powerful new war drama from Alcon Entertainment, Black Label Media and Jerry Bruckheimer Films. \n\nSet in the harrowing days following 9/11, a U.S. Special Forces team, led by their new Captain, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), is chosen to be the first U.S. troops sent into Afghanistan for an extremely dangerous mission. There, in the rugged mountains, they must convince Northern Alliance General Dostum (Navid Negahban) to join forces with them to fight their common adversary: the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies. In addition to overcoming mutual distrust and a vast cultural divide, the Americans—accustomed to state-of-the-art warfare—must adopt the rudimentary tactics of the Afghani horse soldiers. But despite their uneasy bond, the new allies face overwhelming odds: outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy that does not take prisoners.\n\nDirected by Nicolai Fuglsig and based on the acclaimed “Horse Soldiers” book by best-selling author Doug Stanton, 12 STRONG also stars Michael Peña, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stowell, Ben O’Toole, Austin Hebert, Kenneth Miller, Kenny Sheard, Jack Kesy, Laith Nakli, Fahim Fazli, Yousuf Azami, Said Taghmaoui, Elsa Pataky, William Fichtner, and Rob Riggle.\n—\nFollow #12StrongMovie on social media:\nhttp://12strongmovie.com \nhttp://facebook.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://twitter.com/12StrongMovie \nhttp://instagram.com/12StrongMovie"

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work.

Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

Your viewing experience will look significantly better if you manually set your YouTube resolution settings to 1440p or 2160p (for desktop, click the gear icon in the lower right). Just leaving it on “Auto HD” results in some pretty intense distortion during a few sections, because when the the colors and patterns get crazy, there’s actually just too much information flying by for YouTube’s normal HD compression. We broke the matrix. The good people of YouTube have been working with us to solve this (it’s a bit rate limitation issue) over the last 24 hours, but there’s no quick fix, and now it’s Thanksgiving in the US, and we’re all with our families. \n\nWe hope you like it!

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://simonscat.theofficialwebshop.com/"

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

There's no significant heat being dissipated on the PCB.\n\nThe music track referenced is an old fairground classic called Dominator:-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dohzrXT09w\nCarl Cox mix:-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYvrXtmrLSY\n\nHere's a universal ebay search link for the meters:-\nhttps://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&LH_BIN=1&_nkw=22mm+voltmeter&_sop=15\n\nIf you enjoy these videos you can help support the channel with a dollar for coffee, cookies and random gadgets for disassembly at:-\nhttp://www.bigclive.com/coffee.htm\nThis also keeps the channel independent of YouTube's advertising algorithms allowing it to be a bit more dangerous and naughty."

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA. You can purchase Simon's Cat products from the official webshop - https://simonscat.theofficialwebshop.com/"

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension.

There are 3.5 million professional drivers in the US, all of whom may face job displacement in the autonomous future being developed by companies like Otto, Daimler, and Tesla. But before robots take the wheel entirely, there will be a long period where truckers and artificial technology split the responsibilities of the work. The first big step toward that future comes in the form of the electronic logging device, a dashboard monitor that tracks speed, location, and a driver's schedule, and reports it to an employer or a third-party monitoring service.

Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."

In the event of the next one causing serious damage, make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nHere is what you'll need!\n\nEarthquake Preparedness\nEarthquakes are one the world's most deadly natural hazards. Large earthquakes often strike without warning in areas of high population density, which can lead to catastrophic events. \nIt is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. 100,000 of those can be felt by people, and of those, 100 of them cause damage. \nIn the US alone, the NEIC now locates about 20,000 earthquakes each year, or approximately 55 per day.  All 50 states and 5 US territories can get earthquakes, but the risk is higher in identified seismic zones. Some of the areas most at risk include: the San Andreas Fault in California; the Cascadia Subduction Zone in Oregon, Washington, and Alaska; the New Madrid Fault Zone in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky; and smaller East Coast zones such as the mid-Atlantic, coastal South Carolina, and New England\n\nEarthquakes occur without warning and can affect everyone in a region within seconds. Make sure you’re prepared with these handy tips.\n\nEMERGENCY TOILET & SUPPLY KIT\n\nMATERIALS\n5-gallon bucket with lid\nPool noodle\nTrash bags (minimum 5-gallon capacity)\nToilet paper\n2-gallon bucket with lid\nEmergency supplies to suit your needs\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nTrim a pool noodle to fit the circumference of the 5-gallon bucket. \nUsing a sharp utility knife or sturdy scissors, cut a slit down the length of the pool noodle to open it up. Be careful to only cut through only one side.\nLine the bucket with heavy duty trash bags. For safety and hygiene, use at least 2 bags to start.\nFit the pool noodle onto the opening of the bucket, over the bags. \nPop the steel handle off the side of the bucket. Thread a roll of toilet paper through and pop the handle back into the side.\nFill the smaller 2-gallon bucket with emergency supplies that you and your family will need (don’t forget your pets too!). \nStart with a custom emergency checklist that includes important phone numbers you’ll need, medications, and supplies that you’ll need to check periodically.\nFood & water - ideally you should include enough drinking water and shelf-stable, nonperishable food to last you and your family for 72 hours. \nFoods that don’t require cooking or heating are best; and if using canned food, check if you need to also include a can opener! Drop some cutlery in the kit too.\nSchedule to check all expiration dates as necessary and remember that water bottles have use-by dates also.\nHand crank portable radio - it may be necessary to rely on news and communication if power is disrupted and lines are down. Include extra batteries.\nPortable lighting - flashlights, light sticks or other battery-powered LED lights are best. Avoid candles in case of potential gas hazards. Include spare batteries, and test batteries periodically.\nFirst aid kit and toiletries, including any prescription and over-the-counter medications, glasses, contact lenses and solution etc\nWet hygiene wipes for body and hands and hand sanitizer are useful if the water goes out\nDust mask and gloves\nShelter and warmth - emergency blankets, regular blankets, tarps, even just an old towel, hand warmers\nToolkit - wrench in case you need to shut of gas or water valves, and a multi-purpose tool for general needs.\nStore the smaller bucket inside the larger bucket. The pool noodle can be removed from the top and stored inside too, along with the toilet paper. Keep the bucket in a handy location.\nAdditional and duplicate supplies should be stored separately in easily accessible locations around the house and other frequented places like your car, workplace etc. \n\n \nQUAKE-PROOFED HOME\nIt’s best not to have heavy objects like mirrors or large frames hung or displayed above beds or couches. Otherwise, anchor them in studs or interlocked hooks to prevent them from falling and causing serious injury.\nClose hooks from other hanging items by bending them shut with pliers or wrapping them with wire.\nSecure precarious furniture such as tall shelves and television screens with furniture straps or L-shaped braces.\nUse museum putty or other nonpermanent sticky putty to hold smaller breakables in place.\nAlternatively, install low, decorative guardrails across shelves and display units to keep items from sliding off. A simple lip from scrap wood can also do the trick.\nAvoid keeping the heaviest items on the top.\nKeep a pair of sturdy shoes, a flashlight and even a hard hat under your bed.\nAttach velcro to additional flashlights and store them near electrical panels, gas and water valves, and other important utilities for quick access.\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty"

Here's the real reason you're so tired. Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nDr. Daniel Barone: So the myth is that turkey has a lot of a chemical known as tryptophan, which is actually the precursor to melatonin. So people think that when you, around Thanksgiving time, when you have a lot of turkey, that makes you tired because of all the tryptophan that you're eating gets produced into melatonin and then it makes us fall asleep.\n\nThat’s actually not true, the reason why we tend to be tired after we have a large meal of Thanksgiving is simply because of the amount of food that we're having we have what's called postprandial fatigue, which is basically after you've had a big meal your body goes into basically shutdown mode and sleep gets promoted.\n\nThat's why that's why a lot of other countries have siestas for this reason. After lunch, the body goes into postprandial fatigue and then having a little nap can be can be very nice.\n\nAfter we have a big meal, especially around lunchtime, the body just naturally has its own internal clock which tells us that we should be falling asleep around that time.\n\nFalling asleep or being in a relaxed state after you've had a meal helps somebody digest it and use those nutrients to heal the body and repair the damage that’s occurred.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

A Chinese takeout container unfolds into a plate! \nRemove the metal handle from the box, and unfold the tabs on either side. It will unfold into a convenient paper plate!  \n\n2. You probably don't realize it, but your pots come with built-in spoon rests.\nDon’t rest your stirring spoon on the kitchen counter, it will only spread mess! Instead, put your spoon into the hole at the end of your pot handle.\n\n3.You've been dispensing Tic Tacs the hard way.\nYou probably dispense your mints by furiously shaking the box upside down, only for a heap of them to spill out. Instead turn the box upside down, slowly open the lid, and then pull the box back. A single mint will be sitting in a tic tac-shaped groove inside the lid. \n\n4. Play Doh is for cleaning wallpaper.\nWhat now is an iconic, squishy, children's toy, was originally invented for the purpose of cleaning wallpaper.\n\n5. Your bobby pins are on upside down\nThe correct way to wear a bobby pin is the flat side up for maximum hold! \n\n6. Does your foil roll never stay in the box?\nMost aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and kitchen paper rolls come with punch-in tabs on either sides of the box. The tabs hold the roller in place as you pull on your foil. \n\n7. You're probably using the wrong plunger.\nThe classic brown suction cupped plunger is actually for clearing blockages in a sink, not your toilet! A toilet plunger has a double thrust force cup to help get deep down into the block and has extra force for tough clogs. \n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeednifty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/33836\n\n\nMUSIC\nBoss Man\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc."

That’s thanks to a design concept called “shared space,” where urban planners drastically lessen the presence of traffic lights, signs, and barriers, encouraging all forms of transportation to share the road.  There’s evidence that drivers often totally ignore road signs, so the heightened risk forces commuters to remain on high alert as they pass through an intersection, in theory leading to safer travel. But by stripping cities of their traditional traffic control systems, they leave disabled residents in the dark — and that’s sparked a powerful debate of how to balance ease of movement with all residents’ needs. \n\nThis is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of Radiotopia.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA.

Additional observations brought more surprises: the object is cigar-shaped with a somewhat reddish hue. The asteroid, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That is unlike any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date, and may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.

Animation by Drew Berry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. http://wehi.tv\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nJoshua Abenir, Tony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nEvery day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.\n\nTo make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.\n\nAnd cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.\n\nThis is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.\n\nNow the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.\nIt literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.\nSo it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.\n\nTo prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.\nThese nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\nYou can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.\n\nThe process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.\nAs simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.\nThe kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.\nWhile the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide\nThe kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.\nAt this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.\n\nStudio filming by Raquel Nuno"

A positive body image help children develop socially. Quality time with kids also helps them in school. But just as important are avoiding mistakes that can curtail a child's social, physical, emotional and intellectual development. The following is a transcript of this video.\n\nParents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common.\n\nThey're authoritarian. Authoritarian parents discourage open communication. They make demands without explaining why. One study showed, when these parents checked children's homework it inhibited the child's overall school performance.\n\nParents who let kids watch TV when they're really young. Researchers said children who watched more TV were less likely to participate in class and had lower math scores. \n\nParents who yell at their kids a lot. Shouting, cursing and insults can have the same negative effects as physical discipline.\n\nThey're helicopter parents. Over-controlling parents have been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in children. Researchers found these children were less open to new ideas and more self-conscious.\n\nParents who are emotionally distant. This can contribute to: behavioral problems, insecurity, and emotional difficulties.\n\nParents who spank their kids. First graders who already had behavioral problems were even more disruptive if their parents spanked them. Spanking has also been linked to mental health problems and cognitive difficulties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nFollow BI Video on Twitter: http://bit.ly/1oS68Zs\nFollow BI on Facebook: http://bit.ly/1W9Lk0n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBusiness Insider is the fastest growing business news site in the US.

Do you know if Kenneth Branagh is coming back?\n\nCameron - I often see people talk about Marvel, DC, Universal and the Conjuring when it comes to cinematic universes, but how come no one talks about Legendary's Monsterverse? They seem to being well critically and financially, plus there's only four confirmed movies (Godzilla 2014, Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of Monsters and Godzilla vs. Kong) with two coming soon.\n\nSean Burtt - Why is everyone buzzing about this new Tarantino movie, I get that the idea of it is interesting and exciting. But the reports are that it had a $93 million budget, did no one pay attention to Hateful eight, it made no money. So why would Sony pay all this money when history doesn't really justify it.\n\nKyle - Recently, some former colleagues of yours have suggested that JL’s poor performance was due solely because of the response from critics. I find this ridiculous. If critics had that much effect on the opening weekend numbers, why did Suicide Squad open bigger? Why are critics being targeted when they are only trying to protect the consumer?\n\nMarcus Mann - Hey John love your show been watching since the Collider days. You said that several movies that have come out are being miss marketed like JL and Murder on the Orient Express. I saw a trailer for Ready Player One this weekend and have NO idea what it is about. Do you have any thoughts on their marketing of this movie so far?"

He holds the honor of being the first actor in a cable series, and the second lead actor in the history of the Emmy Awards, to receive three consecutive wins. In 2014 he won a Tony Award for his role as Lyndon B. Johnson in the bio-play All the Way. In film, Cranston has won two Screen Actors Guild Awards and received an Academy Award nomination for his leading role in Trumbo. Among his numerous television and film appearances, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and three Emmys for his portrayal of Hal in FOX’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nBryan Cranston landed his first role at seven, when his father, a struggling actor and director, cast him in a United Way commercial. Soon, Bryan was haunting the local movie theater, memorizing and reenacting favorite scenes with his older brother. Acting was clearly the boy’s destiny, until one day his father disappeared. Suddenly, destiny took a back seat to survival.\n\nSeeking something more stable, perhaps subconsciously trying to distance himself from his absent father, Cranston decided on a career in law enforcement. But then, a young man on a classic cross-country motorcycle trip, Cranston one day found himself stranded at a rest area in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Suddenly he thought: This was what he wanted to do, what he would do, with the rest of his life. Act.\n\nEach paid attendee will receive, Brian Cranston’s riveting memoir, A Life in Parts, Cranston traces his zigzag journey from his chaotic childhood to to mega-stardom and a cult-like following\n\nAt the Hudson Union with great humor, and much humility, Cranston will chronicle his unlikely rise from a soap opera regular, trying to learn the ropes and the politics of show business on the fly.  \n\nCranston will dive deep into the grittiest, most fascinating details of his greatest role, explaining how he searched inward for the personal darkness that would help him create one of the most riveting performances ever captured on screen: Walter White, chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin."
